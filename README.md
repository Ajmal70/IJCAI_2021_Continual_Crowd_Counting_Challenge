# IJCAI_2021_Continual_Crowd_Counting_Challenge
Dataset and Baseline for Continual Crowd Counting Challenge @ CSSL 2021 Workshop (IJCAI 2021)

This repo helps the challengers to access dataset and baseline conveniently. The workshop/challenge website is located at:
https://sites.google.com/view/sscl-workshop-ijcai-2021/

The baseline is inspired from the unofficial implementation of CVPR 2016 paper "Single Image Crowd Counting via Multi Column Convolutional Neural Network" at https://github.com/svishwa/crowdcount-mcnn. However, the repo is updated with latest pytorch version and unsupervised training part.

## Dataset Description

The dataset is designed to test continual semi-supervised learning for crowd counting in video frames. This benchmark consists of the union of three existing datasets (Mall, UCSD and FDST), augmented with the relevant ground truth in terms of density maps.

The description of training, validation and testing is described in this file briefly.
